Setup with SampleUsage Scripts:
---------------------------------
1. Copy all scripts from SampleUsage to the directory this README lives in
2. Rename all occurences of PROJECT in these scripts with your project's name.
Info: it's assumed that your project's .uproject lives in ./../../PROJECT, 
but you can adjust that in the sample scripts as you wish.

Day-to-Day Usage:
---------------------------------
1. Open command line terminal in this directory
2. Run BuildZip_PROJECT.cmd from this directory
3. Find the finished build and zip in the Builds/ directory

Notes on Feature-Completeness
---------------------------------
This project is heavily work in progress.

Important!
- Ignore the contents of Config and Scripts (for now).
- GoogleDrive and Steam deployment are deactivated for now.

GoogleDrive deployment works, but needs some special user authorization setup.
Ask me if interested :)
